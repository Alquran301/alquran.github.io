    <h3>Arabic text and English translation with contemplations and references included</h3>
    <h2>Al-Fatihah</h2>
    <h3>(Supplication for Guidance to The Straight Path)</h3>
    <h3> بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
    <h2>اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعٰلَمِیْنَ(1) الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِیْمِ(2) مٰلِكِ یَوْمِ الدِّیْنِﭤ(3) اِیَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَ اِیَّاكَ نَسْتَعِیْنُﭤ(4) اِهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِیْمَ(5) صِرَاطَ الَّذِیْنَ اَنْعَمْتَ عَلَیْهِمْ  غَیْرِ الْمَغْضُوْبِ عَلَیْهِمْ وَ لَا الضَّآلِّیْنَ(7)</h2>
    <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
    <p>“It is You we worship identifies the objective, and it is You we seek for help states the means of achieving that objective. Allah is the means of worshipping Allah. The beginning is from Allah and the end is to Allah. Ibn-Taymiyah.</p>

    <h3> بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
    <h3>(Supplication for the Acceptance of Acts of Worship)</h3>
      <h2>رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلۡ مِنَّاۤۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِیعُ ٱلۡعَلِیم</h2>
      <h3><i>Our Lord, accept (this) from us.Indeed You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. (Qur'an 2:127)</i></h3>
      <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
      <p>Although Prophets Ibraheem and Isma'eel were carrying out Allah's command by raising the foundations of the Ka'bah, they were still concerned that Allah might not accept this deed from them. This is a direct result of the humility and
      humbleness with which they worshipped Allah, and so they supplicated in earnest hope that Allah would accept this magnificent act of worship and that it would bring benefit to nations and generations to come. Tafseer As-Sa'di.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3> بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
      <h3>(Supplication for Guidance, Forgiveness and for the Guidance of One's Children)</h3>
      <h2>رَبَّنَا وَٱجۡعَلۡنَا مُسۡلِمَيۡنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِنَآ أُمَّةٗ مُّسۡلِمَةٗ لَّكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبۡ عَلَيۡنَآۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ</h2>
      <h3><i>Our Lord, and make us submit to You, and from our descendants a nation that submits to You. And show us our rites and accept our repentance. Indeed, You are the Continually-Accepting of Repentance, the All-Merciful. (Quran 2:128)</i></h3>
      <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
      <p>Prophets Ibraheem and Isma'eel ask Allah to raise from their descendants a people who would submit themselves, in both heart and body, to His Will. They ask Allah that He teaches these descendants different acts of worship—both specific to the rites of Pilgrimage and those more general than that.
        This admirable supplication is essentially a request that Allah bless them with sincerity and the ability to do righteous deeds. Regardless of a servant,s virtue, sincerity, or devotion to their Lord, shortcomings
        in one's duty to Allah are inevitable. For this reason, they both ask Allah to forgive them for such shortcomings and to accept their repentance. Tafseer As-Sa'di.

        <h3> بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
        <h3>(Supplication for Contentment and Safety in This Life and in The Hereafter)</h3>
        <h2>رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِي ٱلدُّنۡيَا حَسَنَةٗ وَفِي ٱلۡأٓخِرَةِ حَسَنَةٗ وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ</h2>
        <h3><i>Our Lord, grant us what is good in this life, and what is good in the Hereafter, and protect us against the punishment of Hellfire. (Quran 2:201)</i></h3>
        <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
        <p>This supplication brings together the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter, just as it is a supplication for safety against evil in both worlds. The good of this life includes things like wellness, a comfortable home, a righteous spouse, generous provision, beneficial knowledge,
          the practice of righteous deeds, a comfortable means of transport, an honorable reputation among one's peers, and other blessings. Good in the Hereafter includes entering Paradise
          and attaining its luxury and security, remaining steadfast when questioned about one's deeds, and attaining safety and security in every other situation. Protection against the punishment of Hellfire necessitates that one is granted protection against its preconditions in this life.
          Hence, this is also a supplication that Allah safeguards us against falling into what is prohibited as well as any doubtful matters that may lead to sin. —Ibn Katheer.

          <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
          <h3>(Supplication for Steadfastness and Victory over the Unbelievers)</h3>
          <h2>رَبَّنَآ أَفۡرِغۡ عَلَيۡنَا صَبۡرٗا وَثَبِّتۡ أَقۡدَامَنَا وَٱنصُرۡنَا عَلَى ٱلۡقَوۡمِ ٱلۡكَٰفِرِينَ</h2>
          <h3><i>Our Lord, pour patience upon us, plant firmly our feet and grant us victory
            over the unbelieving people. (Quran 2:250)</i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>Gruelling situations require an abundance of patience and perseverance, and so rather than simply asking Allah for patience, the Believers ask Allah to pour patience down upon them. Tafseer at-Tahreer wa'l-Tanweer.</p>
            <hr>
             
            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for Forgiveness and Obedience to Allah)</h3>
            <h2>رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذۡنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوۡ أَخۡطَأۡنَاۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحۡمِلۡ عَلَيۡنَآ إِصۡرٗا كَمَا حَمَلۡتَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبۡلِنَاۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلۡنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِۦۖ وَٱعۡفُ عَنَّا وَٱغۡفِرۡ لَنَا وَٱرۡحَمۡنَآۚ أَنتَ مَوۡلَىٰنَا فَٱنصُرۡنَا عَلَى ٱلۡقَوۡمِ ٱلۡكَٰفِرينَ</h2>
            <h3><i>We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the "final" destination. (Quran 2:285)</i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>To hear is to listen attentively and understand what is required, and to obey is to adhere to Allah's commands and stay clear of His prohibitions. Because it is only natural that there will be shortcomings in one's obedience to Allah, the Believers ask Allah for forgiveness for these shortcomings. Ibn Katheer and As-Sa'di.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for Steadfastness in Faith)</h3>
           <h2>رَبَّنَا لَا تُزِغۡ قُلُوبَنَا بَعۡدَ إِذۡ هَدَيۡتَنَا وَهَبۡ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحۡمَةًۚ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلۡوَهَّابُ</h2>
           <h3><i>Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy.(Quran 3:8)</i></h3>
           <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
           <P>This supplication comes after Allah mentions those who try to seek out and follow verses that might seem obscure in the Quran. Such misguided
            individuals do this in an effort to sow confusion in the hearts of others and to interpret the Quran's verses as they please. Allah states that these are people whose hearts hold an inclination to deviate, and so the Believers ask Allah to protect them against such evil.At-Tabari and others.
            </P>
            <hr>
            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for Forgiveness and Safety in the Hereafter)</h3>
            <h2>رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ ٱلنَّاسِ لِيَوۡمٖ لَّا رَيۡبَ فِيهِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُخۡلِفُ ٱلۡمِيعَادَ</h2>
            <h3><i>Our Lord, surely You will gather the people for a Day about which there is no doubt. Indeed, Allah does not fail in His promise.(Quran 3:9)</i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>The supplication in this Ayah is implicit. Here, the Believers are asking Allah to forgive their sins so that they will not be held accountable for them on the
              Day of Judgment. Because Allah has promised to forgive the sins of those who Believe in Him and follow His Prophet, Sallallahu 'alaihi wasallam, and adhere to His Book, the Believers beseech Allah by means of this promise, and state that He never fails to uphold His promise. At-Tabari and others.
            </p>

            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for Forgiveness and Safety against the Punishment of Hellfir)</h3>
            <h2>رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</h2>
            <h3><i>“Our Lord, truly we have believed, and so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”(Quran 3:16)</i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>In the Ayah preceding this one, Allah mentions some of the rewards Paradise has in store for the pious (those who have Taqwa). Here, He mentions that these same pious Believers invoke Him with the supplication mentioned above. Hence, it is the pious, or those who refrain from what Allah has forbidden, who will attain His forgiveness and His protection from the Hellfire. This, therefore, excludes those who ask for forgiveness with nothing more than their tongues, and without doing what is required to attain forgiveness. Tafseer at-Tahreer wa'l-Tanweer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for One's Debt to Be Paid Off or for Other Needs to Be Met)</h3>
            <h2>قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَٰلِكَ ٱلۡمُلۡكِ تُؤۡتِي ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُۖ بِيَدِكَ ٱلۡخَيۡرُۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞ</h2>
            <h3><i>Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You wrench sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You degrade whom You will. In Your Hand lies all good. Indeed, You are capable of all things.” (Quran 3:26)</i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>While the meanings of this Ayah are general, the specific context is that they are part of a response to the Christian creed. A god that can be crucified (as is claimed) by his own creation is not a god
            who owns sovereignty, let alone a god who is capable of bestowing sovereignty or taking it away from anyone else, or of bringing harm or benefit to anyone else. These verses are also part of a supplication that the Prophet, Sallallahu'alaihi wasallam, taught as a means of asking Allah to pay off debts, no matter how large. —Various Tafseers including Aysar At-Tafaseer and At-Tabari.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for Righteous Offspring)</h3>
            <h2>رَبِّ هَبۡ لِي مِن لَّدُنكَ ذُرِّيَّةٗ طَيِّبَةًۖ إِنَّكَ سَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ</h2>
            <h3><i>My Lord, grant me from Yourself righteous progeny. Indeed, you are All-Hearing [and responsive] to invocations. (Quran 3:38)</i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>Because Prophet Zakariyyah and his wife had aged and, hence, lost the physical means of bearing children, Zakariyyah asks Allah for a child and uses the words from Yourself. In other words, this will be a gift that is not the product of any material means, for all such means no longer exist. Hence, this gift can only be a blessing that Allah bestows out of nothing more than His will and graciousness and without conventional, physical human requirements.
            The word (Samee) means All-Hearing and is an attribute of Allah, but in this context, it refers to Allah's capacity to answer prayers or supplications. Zahrat-al-Tafseer and others.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for Allah's Acceptance and an Acknowledgment of Faith in Allah's Revelation and Prophets)</h3>
            <h2>رَبَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا بِمَآ أَنزَلۡتَ وَٱتَّبَعۡنَا ٱلرَّسُولَ فَٱكۡتُبۡنَا مَعَ ٱلشَّـٰهِدِينَ</h2>
            <h3><i>Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed and have followed the messenger [Jesus], and so register us among the witnesses to the Truth. (Quran 3:53)</i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>These are the words of the true followers of Prophet Jesus and of every Believer. Allah mentions their supplication so that we might follow in their footsteps and know that the truth has always been to worship no one but Allah and to follow His prophets. In the context of this chapter, this verse is another response to Christians, for they have adulterated the true message of Prophet Jesus and every other prophet of Allah. At-Tabari and others.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>
            <h3>(Supplication for Forgiveness,Patience, and Steadfastness)</h3>
            <h2>رَبَّنَا ٱغۡفِرۡ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَإِسۡرَافَنَا فِيٓ أَمۡرِنَا وَثَبِّتۡ أَقۡدَامَنَا وَٱنصُرۡنَا عَلَى ٱلۡقَوۡمِ ٱلۡكَٰفِرِينَ</h2>
            <h3><i>Our Lord, forgive us our sins and the excess [committed] in our affairs and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people.(Quran 3:147)
            </i></h3>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
            <p>These verses were revealed after Uhud when rumours spread that the Prophet, Sallallahu'alaihi 
              wassalam, had been killed. Allah tells the Companions of previous generations of Believers who 
              were afflicted with trials and tribulations yet remained firm. They knew that sins were a reason 
              why Allah inflicts His slaves with defeat, and so they asked Allah to forgive both their minor sins 
              and their excessive transgression (or major sins). Rather than taking confidence in their own 
              patience, they also asked Allah to make them steadfast and to plant firmly their feet when they 
              confront their enemies. At-Tabari and others.

              <h3>(For Reward In This Life And The Hereafter, And Safety Against The Evils Of Judgment Day)</h3>
              <h2>رَبَّنَا وَءَاتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ وَلَا تُخۡزِنَا يَوۡمَ ٱلۡقِيَٰمَةِۖ إِنَّكَ لَا تُخۡلِفُ ٱلۡمِيعَادَ</h2>
              <h3><i>Our Lord, and grant us what You promised us through Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail in Your promise. (Quran 3:194)</i></h3>
              <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
              <p>After asking Allah to forgive their sins and make them among the righteous, the Believers then ask Him to grant them the rewards that He has promised them in this life and in the Hereafter. Victory and strength are among the rewards Allah has promised His believing slaves in this life, while in the next life, He has promised comfort, safety, and honor. Tafseer As-Sadi.

                <h3><i>Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a viceroy and appoint for us from Yourself a defender. (Quran 4:75)</i></h3>
                <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
                <p>This Ayah was revealed concerning those helpless Believers who were still in Makkah before the conquest of Makkah. Allah answered their prayers and granted them someone who would undertake their affairs and defend them against the injustice of those who oppressed them. Tafseer Al-Baghawi.</p>

                <h3><i>Our Lord, we have believed, so register us among the witnesses. (Quran 5:83)</i></h3>
                <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
                <p>These words were spoken by Christians who saw and accepted the Truth of Islam once they had heard Allah's verses. Upon accepting Islam, they declared their faith and asked Allah to register them along with the witnesses, who are, in fact, the Muslims.Tafseer As-Sa'di.</p>

                <h3><i>Our Lord, decide between us and our people in truth, and You are the best of those who give decision. (Quran 7:89)</i></h3>
                <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
                <p>After having advised his people and shown them right from wrong, Prophet Shu'aib saw that they would not accept the truth and that,
                  in fact, they only became more hostile and stubborn. Hence, he invoked Allah to judge between those who upheld the truth from those who rejected it by descending His punishment upon the evildoers.</p>

                  <h3>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h3>

                  <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
                  <p>These words were spoken by Pharaoh's magicians once they had seen and accepted the truth of Prophet Musa's miracles. Rather than simply asking for patience, they asked Allah to pour patience down upon them abundantly, as this was an enormously difficult moment and they knew that Pharaoh would kill them. Commentators have noted that the
                  magicians were unbelieving magicians at the beginning of that day and martyrs at the end of it. At-Tabari.</p>

                 <h4>CONTEMPLATIONS:</h4>
                 <p>Prophet Musa asks Allah to admit him and his brother, Harun, into His mercy. 
                  This is different than simply asking Allah to have mercy upon them. To admit 
                  them into his mercy is to allow His mercy to encompass them from all sides 
                  so that it protects them completely. —Tafseer As-Sa'di.
